Four Letter Words is a simple puzzle game with the challenge of changing one four letter word into another four letter word one letter at a time.

After entering the source (Src Word) word and the target word (Target Word) press ^P (Find Path to Target) to see if a path between the two can be found.

It is also possible to generate a list of words like the Src Word by pressing ^W (Find Similar Words).

It is also to build a file of words that have NO one letter difference connections to any other words or a file of words that have the maximum possible one letter difference connections to other words. These options are in the Functions menu.
